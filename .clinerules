# Cline Rules for this Project

1. Do not include TUI/interactive display commands in attempt_completion results
   - The user will run interactive terminal commands directly (e.g. TUI apps, animations, games)
   - The user will share screenshots when appropriate for visual feedback
   - Regular commands (git, file operations, etc.) can still be included in attempt_completion
   - This helps reduce token usage for interpreting complex visual/interactive outputs
